# Performance-Uniform Space Warping for Analog Layout Placement

## Abstract

This document presents a novel approach to analog/AMS circuit layout placement by warping the physical placement space into a performance-uniform coordinate system, inspired by perceptually-uniform color spaces like OKLAB.

## Core Concept

### Analogy to Color Spaces

In color theory:
- **RGB Space**: Hardware-centric, perceptually non-uniform
- **OKLAB/CIELAB**: Perceptually uniform spaces where equal distances correspond to equal perceived differences

Similarly, in analog layout:
- **Physical Grid Space**: Manufacturing-centric, performance non-uniform
- **Warped Performance Space**: Performance-uniform space where equal distances correspond to equal performance impact

## Mathematical Framework

### Space Transformation

Original placement space: `(x, y)` - discrete grid coordinates

Warped performance space: `(u, v)` - continuous performance-aware coordinates

Transformation function:
```
u = f(x, y, circuit_context)
v = g(x, y, circuit_context)
```

### Performance Metric Tensor

At each point in physical space, define a metric tensor M that captures performance sensitivity:

```
M(x,y) = [
    ∂P/∂x   ∂²P/∂x∂y
    ∂²P/∂x∂y   ∂P/∂y
]
```

Where P represents performance metrics (gain, bandwidth, noise, etc.)

### Distance in Warped Space

The distance between two points in warped space:
```
ds² = dx^T · M · dx
```

This creates a Riemannian manifold where distances reflect performance impact.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Force-Directed Placement with Discrete Moves

```
for each block in circuit:
    1. Calculate net force on block
    2. Find best discrete grid position aligned with force
    3. Move block to new position
```

Key advantages:
- O(n × m) complexity vs O(n × g^n) for full state exploration
- No need to pre-compute entire placement graph
- Direct force-to-move mapping

### 2. Multi-Objective Warping

Different performance metrics create different warped spaces:
- Gain uniformity space
- Noise uniformity space  
- Power uniformity space
- Thermal uniformity space

Placement optimization finds positions that are favorable in all warped spaces.

### 3. Adaptive Warping

The warping function adapts based on:
- Already placed components
- Learned performance gradients
- Measured vs predicted performance

## Key Innovations

1. **Perceptual Uniformity Concept Applied to Layout**: Borrowing from color science to create intuitive performance spaces

2. **Performance-Aware Coordinate System**: Physical distances become less relevant than performance distances

3. **Dynamic Warping**: The transformation adapts as components are placed, capturing interaction effects

4. **Multi-Metric Optimization**: Different performance metrics create different "views" of the same physical space

## Advantages

- **Intuitive**: Distances in warped space directly correlate to performance impact
- **Efficient**: Gradient descent in warped space naturally follows performance contours
- **Flexible**: Can incorporate multiple competing objectives
- **Adaptive**: Learns and refines the warping based on actual simulations

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Computing the Warping Function
**Solution**: Learn from simulations or use analytical models of parasitic effects

### Challenge 2: Dynamic Warping
**Solution**: Update warping incrementally as components are placed

### Challenge 3: Inverse Transform
**Solution**: Maintain bidirectional mapping between physical and warped spaces

### Challenge 4: High-Dimensional Performance Space
**Solution**: Use dimensionality reduction or focus on dominant metrics

## Relationship to Existing Work

### Similar Concepts:
- **Riemannian Optimization**: Used in machine learning, rare in EDA
- **Non-uniform Grids**: Based on density, not performance
- **Design Centering**: For parameter sizing, not spatial placement

### Novel Aspects:
- Application of perceptual uniformity to analog layout
- Performance-based spatial warping
- Integration with force-directed placement

## Potential Applications

1. **Analog Circuit Layout**: Op-amps, ADCs, PLLs
2. **Mixed-Signal Placement**: Managing analog-digital interactions
3. **RF Layout**: Where field effects create complex performance landscapes
4. **Power Electronics**: Thermal and parasitic management

## Future Work

1. Develop learning algorithms for warping functions
2. Extend to 3D IC layout
3. Integrate with existing EDA tools
4. Benchmark against traditional placement methods

## Implementation Considerations

### For Discrete Force-Based Movement:
- Use local grid moves aligned with force vectors
- Implement momentum to avoid oscillations
- Add stochastic elements to escape local minima

### For Performance Evaluation:
- Use fast parasitic estimation for inner loop
- Reserve full simulation for promising candidates
- Build surrogate models for rapid evaluation

## Conclusion

By warping the physical placement space into a performance-uniform coordinate system, we can:
- Make placement optimization more intuitive
- Improve convergence to high-quality solutions
- Handle multiple competing objectives naturally
- Bridge the gap between continuous optimization and discrete placement

This approach represents a fundamental shift in how we think about analog layout - from optimizing in physical space to optimizing in performance space.
